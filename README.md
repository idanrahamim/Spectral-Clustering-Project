# Spectral-Clustering-Project
A broad academic project constituting the implementation of diverse algos ("Spectral Clustering, k-means++" among others):
  Spectral Clustering - splitting vector points into a set of clusters, which represent the points similarity using k-means++ algorithm.
  Implemented linear algebra theorems usind numpy.
  Porting c code into c extension usind C API
  Creating a reproducible workflow to allow an easy installation of your code, using the invoke framework
  Generation of data and visualization

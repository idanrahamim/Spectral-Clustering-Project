# Spectral-Clustering-Project
A broad academic project constits the implementation of diverse algos ("Spectral Clustering, k-means++" among others):
 - Spectral Clustering - splitting vector points into a set of clusters, which represent the points similarity using k-means++ algorithm.
 - Implemented linear algebra theorems usind numpy.
 - Porting c code into c extension usind C API
 - Creating a reproducible workflow to allow an easy installation of your code, using the invoke framework
 - Generation of data and visualization
